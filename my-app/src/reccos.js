const gta = "Guns, cars, violence, and explosions—this truly is a Steven Spielberg movie on steroids. If you have ever wanted to feel like a domestic terrorist (for some reason), then this bastion of anarchy will definitely satisfy that lust."
const alienisolation = "Was I screaming? Yes. Was I peeking from under my desk to pilot Amanda Ripley through the Sevastopol? Yes. Am I ashamed of it? Well…yes. Will I do it all over again? Absolutely."
const nier = "If you have never cried or gotten goosebumps from music, I don’t blame you—music nowadays just isn’t that great. But play this, and I guarantee you, with this game’s soundtrack, that you’ll finally feel the sweet release of frisson."
const cyberpunk = "A cautionary tale that makes you ponder how bad ultra-capitalism will truly be for us. Safe to say that I'll do my very best to not overconsume. Wait—didn't I just pay 100 dollars for this game and its merchandise?!";
const rdr2 = "I’m serious when I say I grew a couple of chesthairs and the stride of an outlaw after a couple of hours hammering at this game. Oh, and as quickly as it does that, it then immediately turns you into a sobbing mess. 100/10."
const dbh = "What makes an incredibly advanced AI that shows joy, anger, and sorrow not human? With the way things are moving, now's maybe a good time to sympathize with our pseudoselves (I’m looking at you, Roko's basilisk)."
const tlou = "If pandemics and zombies are your thing, then TLoU series is for you. As you venture across settlements and post-apocalyptic cities, you can't help but wonder if we are the true monsters after all."
const plaguetale = "Follow the de Rune siblings as they fight hordes of flesh hungry, evil rats to find a cure to Hugo's curse in this unique rendition of The Black Death. Word of caution: do not play this if you have a pet rat.";
